# Penetration_test_report
These reports were written for QuoccaBank, a digital bank that secedu staff create aim for providing a platform to practice penatration testing.

## Report 1

The team at QuoccaBank has been very impressed to see the progress you have made this past month. So they have decided to ask for an interim document describing how they are vulnerable to attack.
## Task
Find as many vulnerabilities as you can from weeks 1-5 and write a report detailing your findings.
## Details
In order for QuoccaBank to understand how they might be vulnerable, you are required to submit a single report which includes a holistic discussion about the perceived vulnerabilities of QuoccaBank and the details of any specific vulnerabilities you have found.
In your report you should discuss:
- Recon vulnerabilities
- Authentication and user access vulnerabilities
- Injection & Server-side vulnerabilities
However, Quoccabank has been so impressed with your wholistic approach to security that they don't want to limit you to just the above topics. Please include any other ways you think QuoccaBank may be vulnerable.

The report should describe the vulnerabilities in detail, using example code and screenshots where appropriate to explain the vulnerability to someone who has never seen it before. Talk about the impact this vulnerability would have on the bank and generally what technical solution they could use to patch the vulnerability.
 
The overall structure should be as follows; for each vulnerability talk about the following:
- Vulnerability Details
- Proof of Concept / Steps to Reproduce
- Impact
- Remediation

## Report 2

## Task
Find as many vulnerabilities as you can from weeks 7-10 and write a report detailing your findings. You will also need to complete part 2 of the report which you can access (here) and submit it as part of your overall report.

The report is to be written collaboratively in teams of 3-4. 

Marking Criteria
You will be marked based on the number/severity of vulnerabilities you find and the quality of your report. You will receive very little marks for just submitting a list of vulnerabilities, make sure you explain all the vulnerabilities in detail.
